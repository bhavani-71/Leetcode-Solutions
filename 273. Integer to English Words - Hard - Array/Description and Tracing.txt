📌 Title: Integer to English Words  
🔗 Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-english-words/

🧩 Problem Statement:  
Convert a non-negative integer to its English words representation. The input is guaranteed to be less than 2³¹ - 1.

🧱 Components:  
- Input: Integer `n` (0 ≤ n ≤ 2³¹ - 1)  
- Output: English word representation of `n`  
- Helper function: Recursively converts 3-digit numbers  
- Predefined arrays for:
  - Numbers below 20  
  - Tens multiples  
  - Thousands/millions/billions scale

💡 Brute Force Approach:  
- Convert the number to a string  
- Parse and split based on digit places (units, tens, hundreds, etc.)  
- Manually map digits to words  
- Handle special cases for 10-19  
- ❌ Inefficient, error-prone, and verbose  
- ❌ No modularity and difficult to maintain

🚀 Optimized Approach (Used in Code):  
- 🔁 Iterate over chunks of 3 digits (thousands)  
- 🧠 Use recursion (`helper`) to convert each 3-digit segment  
- 🧱 Append correct scale from `["", "Thousand", "Million", "Billion"]`  
- ✅ Modular, clean, and scalable  
- ✅ Efficient with O(log n) time (base 1000 due to chunking)

🔍 Code Trace Example for Input: 1234567  
💭 Chunks: ["1", "234", "567"] (Million, Thousand, base)  
🔁 Iteration 1:  
  🔹 helper(567) → "Five Hundred Sixty Seven"  
  🔹 Append "" → "Five Hundred Sixty Seven"  
🔁 Iteration 2:  
  🔹 helper(234) → "Two Hundred Thirty Four"  
  🔹 Append "Thousand" → "Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Seven"  
🔁 Iteration 3:  
  🔹 helper(1) → "One"  
  🔹 Append "Million" → "One Million Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Seven"
